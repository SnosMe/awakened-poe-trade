1. Read the [requirements](https://snosme.github.io/awakened-poe-trade/download.md) again.

    Please do it. Did you know that updating Geforce Experience can reset game
    video settings to "optimized profile" and silently enable Fullscreen mode?

2. [Check the logs](/docs/faq.md).

3. Are you playing with Vulkan renderer? Update GPU drivers.

    If Awakened works for you with DirectX11/12 renderer,
    then problem is old Vulkan drivers for sure.

4. Delete `%appdata%\awakened-poe-trade`

    If needed, backup `apt-data` folder with your configuration inside.

5. **Close all applications** that you can in tray and task manager.

    Launch them later one at a time to identify **conflict**.

6. Restart Awakened PoE Trade.

    *(don't forget to quit first, otherwise launching second instance will do nothing).*

7. As last resort, go to Discord. But if you don't describe something specific about
    your problem, **you will most likely be directed to this page**.

#### First of all, how does it work? {:style="margin-top: 0;"}

When you press `Ctrl + C` Path of Exile copies the item's text (under cursor, if any) to the clipboard.
All that remains is to parse text in Awakened PoE Trade and show to you in a fancy way.

Some functions don't have hotkeys assigned by default to avoid conflicts on your system.
You can set them and change default hotkeys in the [Settings](/faq).

### Price Check Window

When Price checking this item:

the following window will appear:
![Pricing Exmaple](https://imgur.com/HYRmois.png)

The app does not magically check the price of your item. You tick the checkboxes and relevant filters for the item yourself. Choose stats that synergize well, **this knowledge only comes from playing different build archetypes**.

You may notice that some stats from the item are missing, this is because they have been grouped into "pseudo" stats. For example, the spell damage from 3 mods on this wand have been grouped together into one pseudo spell damage stat with a value of all the mods combined.

The numbers on the side of each filter indicate the min-max range to search for on the trade site. They are automatically filled in with a slight decrease in the actual roll so that you can find items on the trade. You can always adjust them manually if you have a perfectly rolled T1 mod, for example.

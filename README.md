## FAQ

- **Typing `Awakened PoE Trade` tires**\
Type `APT` ?

- **How much memory does it need?**

|    | On program load | After some time |
|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| APT | 115 MB         | 68 MB |
| TradeMacro | 60 MB   | 24 MB |

- **Any chance of Linux support**\
Yes it is absolutely possible. (Wishing to help: a problem in the `node-window-manager` library)

- **My mouse and computer freeze when I start the program**\
Bad news: It is unavoidable, some app on your computer uses the same library as APT https://github.com/wilix-team/iohook/issues/93 \
Good news: this only happens for a few seconds
